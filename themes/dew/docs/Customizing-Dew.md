# Customizing Dew

Dew is the new SilverStripe default theme so you will often see it when you first install
SilverStripe. It has been designed to be flexible enough for you to change with new CSS and
images without rewriting all the templates.

## Changing the page width.

The width of the page is controlled by a single class `.container`. It is located under the 
*Base Page Layout* section in layout.css. By default it is set to 880px.
